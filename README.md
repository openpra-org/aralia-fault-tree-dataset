This repository includes generic models in OpenPSA XML format. The goals of including these models are to:

- Serve as test cases for various PRA tools, including [Open-PRA](https://github.com/openpra-org/openpra-monorepo).
- Familiarize users with different modeling approaches and formats.
- Provide a reference for PRA model exchange.
- And more.

The repository also maintains a `schema` for the models.

## 1. OpenPSA Model Exchange Format
The [OpenPSA Model Exchange Format (MEF)](https://open-psa.github.io/mef/index.html) represents about a decade of effort to develop a format independent of any specific 
quantification engine. The goal was to create a standard that researchers, corporations, and regulators could use collaboratively in an open environment.

## 2. Generation of Models
Models were gathered from [SCRAM](https://github.com/rakhimov/scram) project.

## 3. Configuration of Models
Various models are available in different configurations.

## 4. Usage
These models can be used to test quantification engines. Additionally, they enable the creation of a verification platform between quantification engines, allowing developers or practitioners to cross-check their results. Moreover, these models serve as a foundation for benchmarking efforts for any quantification tool.
